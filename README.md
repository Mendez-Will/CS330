How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by breaking down my process from beginning to completion with a focus on modularity to have reusable code that can be manipulated further in other projects, and can make the process much more efficient. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project has helped me develop an eye for primitive shapes, and has given me a fuller understanding of how rendering softwares work. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
 I followed a systematic design process. I developed the code in iterations, saving myself time by going about the programming with this method. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactics from my design approach, such as thorough requirements analysis and iterative design can be applied in future work as just a general rule of thumb. following them will only help my journey. 

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach it the same way I approach designing any software, with iteration and patience. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
 I utilized agile development strategies, including iterative development and continuous integration.

How did iteration factor into your development?
I employed iteration in this project almost every step of the way. I broke down everything and did not miss a step. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach has become much more efficient. instewad of making the entire code in one go and from scratch, I learned to innovate instead of re-invent the wheel. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
It is helping me reach my goals because I plan to enter the technology field when I have completed my degree. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This can be applied by giving me a deeper understanding of C++, as well as showing me another coding avenue to explore. visual studio practice is always a good thing as well.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
They can be applied very easily, as I am working to become a software engineer and can branch into design as an alternative career path.
